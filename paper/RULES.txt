WE WRITE TO PASS OUR KNOWLEDGE
IT IS NOT OBSOLETE
HOW WILL YOU EAT YOUR PORRIDGE?
HOW WILL COLLECT YOUR WHEAT?

FROM THE ZERO?

THE EXAMPLE STEPS ARE SIMPLOUS;

1.   PPROJECTED WITH HANDWRITINGS;
1.1.     Have the paper and the pencil;
1.2.     Write the zero concept. Let us project "Wheat gathering machine" for the example;

1.3.     Split "Wheat gathering machine" [1.2.] to "Wheat" and "Gathering" and "Machine";
1.4.     Write the parts ("Wheat" and "Gathering" and "Machine") of the zero concept [1.2.] from the [1.3.] and ennumerate them as 1.a. and 1.b. and 1.c.;

1.5.     Split the "Wheat" concept to "Field" and "Crops" and "Plants" ("Fields Crops Plants");
1.6.     Write the parts ("Field" and "Crops" and "Plants") of the "Wheat" concept [1.5.] and ennumerate them as 2.a. and 2.b. and 2.c.;

1.7.    Split the "Gathering" concept to "Collecting" and "In enougth amount" ("Collecting in enougth amount");
1.8.    Write the parts ("Collecting" and "In enougth amount") of the "Gathering" concept [1.7.] and ennumerate them as 2.d. and 2.e.;

1.9.    Split the "Machine" concept to "Human" and "Driven" and "Mechanism" ("Human Driven Mechanism");
1.10.   Write the parts ("Human" and "Driven" and "Mechanism") of the "Machine" concept [1.9.] and ennumerate them as 2.f. and 2.g. and 2.h.;

1.11. Repeat the splitting and precisement process for each new concept until you will reach: the full and enougth precise zero concept description or formulae or philosophical dead-end;

2. STORED ON COMPUTER;
2.1. Recreate the graph from the list from step [1] using knet on your computer.

3. PASSED BY PAPERS;
3.1. Print the knowledge branch from the knet onto the paper and pass them to somebody or store them SECURELY somethere.
